## Summary

I downloaded metadata for all relevant articles from PubMed; and deduplicated the authors, and after some normalization, I matched with the given dataset by name. I am matching by name only; matching by institution/country is a little beyond the scope of the task. 

I then save the author names, whether it is a match, all of his/her affiliations, and all the article ids he has written.
The script is quite bulky, since there are more than 400k authors writing on this topic since 1960.
