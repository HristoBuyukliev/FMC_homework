## Summary

I downloaded metadata for all relevant articles from PubMed; and deduplicated the authors, and after some normalization, I matched with the given dataset by name. I am matching by name only; matching by institution/country is a little beyond the scope of the task. 

I then save the author names, whether it is a match, all of his/her affiliations, and all the article ids he has written.

I think that there's around 160k unique authors for this query for pubmed; and for 1695 of them, I think I found an appropriate match in the provided dataset.
